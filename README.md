# Auto-Paper-Summary

We want to build a auto-paper-summary based on LSTM.

For the dataset part, we have two candidates. The first one is DUC 2003 and 2004 dataset. The second one NIST 2015 dataset. Both of those two have great reputation. However, DUC dataset contains lots of unnecessary massages so we prefer NIST 2015 dataset for now.
